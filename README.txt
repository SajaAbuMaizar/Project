About the game:
In the game, the player must bring the king to his throne -chair-.
The problem is that the king is limited in his abilities and can only move on empty tiles on the board.
Thus, The king is accompanied by his entourage that will clear the way for him and help him reach his
goal.
There are four characters that the player has control over:
 ● The King: he can walk on empty tiles, or keys tiles (but he can't take them),
   he can also travel through teleport cells. Lastly, he can sit on the throne.
 ● The Mage: his special ability is to put out fire (by walking over fire tiles).
   He can walk on empty tiles, fire tiles, and key tiles.
   Finally, he can stand on teleport cells but can't travel through them.
 ● The Warrior: his special ability is to fight the orcs (by walking over orcs tiles).
   He can walk on empty tiles, orcs tiles and keys tiles. He can also use teleport cells.
 ● The Thief: his special ability is to take a key (keys appear on the board whenever the warrior
   kills an orc) and open a gate with it. Finally, He can use teleport cells.
   Note that the thief can carry only one key at a time.
The player wins the level when the king reaches his throne.
